# Project 7: Using a Third-Party Library (Pillow)

In this project, you'll use the `Pillow` library to open an image, convert it to grayscale, and save the result as a new file.

## Objectives

- Install and import a third-party library
- Learn how to work with images in Python
- Practice reading documentation and applying examples
- Understand basic file input/output with external formats (images)

## Instructions

1. Install the Pillow library:
   ```bash
   pip install pillow
   ```
2. Make sure you have a .jpg or .png image in the same directory. You can rename it input.jpg or change the filename in the script.
3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
4. The script will create and save a grayscale version as output.jpg.
