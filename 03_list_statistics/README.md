# Project 3: List Statistics

This program takes a list of numbers entered by the user (comma-separated), then calculates and displays the sum, average, maximum, and minimum.

## Objectives

- Use string methods to process input
- Convert strings to numbers
- Use lists and loops
- Use built-in functions like `sum()`, `max()`, `min()`
- Handle invalid input gracefully

## How to run

1. Run the script with:
```bash
python main.py
```
2. Enter numbers separated by commas (e.g., `3, 5, 7, 2`).
3. The program will output statistics about the list.
