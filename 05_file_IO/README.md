# Project 5: Simple File I/O

This project teaches you how to read from and write to files in Python.

## Objectives

- Use Python's built-in file handling functions
- Write user input to a file
- Read and display the contents of a file
- Handle file-not-found errors gracefully

## How to run

1. Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```
2. Enter a sentence when prompted.
3. The sentence will be saved to `user_text.txt`, and the fileâ€™s contents will be printed afterward.
